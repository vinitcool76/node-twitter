# Node Twitter

Node twitter is an experimental twitter clone written in Node.js and MongoDB.
The purpose of this project is to test and experiment with clean architecture and
replicate the social media experience that twitter provides.

## Installation and Running
You must have Node, npm and MongoDB installed.
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

The configuration part is in `config/config.js`. Please create your own
github application and replace the token and keys.

## Important
I work on this project in my own free time so there could be more or less activity depending on how
much time I have at hand. But I would try to keep the `master` pretty much crash free and deployable. Anything
that's on `develop` can break or have bugs.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the project, please send me a PR with a feature/fix, I will try and review
and get back to you as soon as possible. If you find any bugs or feature requests, please open a ticket for it with proper
description.
